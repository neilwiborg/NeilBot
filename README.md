# NeilBot

This project is a bot for Discord that includes functionality that I find entertaining.

#### /anyone_me

This slash command will set the 'anyone' role on your server to the user who executes this slash command and remove the role from all other users.

#### /anyone_rand

This slash command will set the 'anyone' role on your server to a random user and remove the role from all other users.
