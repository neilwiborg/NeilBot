# NeilBot

This project is a bot for Discord that includes functionality that I find entertaining.

#### /join

This slash command will cause the bot to join the same voice channel as the user.

#### /leave

This slash command will cause the bot to leave the voice channel it is connected to.

#### /play `<url>`

This slash command will cause the bot to play audio from the YouTube url passed in.

#### /anyone_me

This slash command will set the 'anyone' role on your server to the user who executes this slash command and remove the role from all other users.

#### /anyone_rand

This slash command will set the 'anyone' role on your server to a random user and remove the role from all other users.
